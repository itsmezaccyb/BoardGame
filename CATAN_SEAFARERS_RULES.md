# Catan: Seafarers - Scenario Rules & Setup Guide

This document contains complete rules and setup instructions for all 9 Catan Seafarers scenarios. Each scenario presents a unique board layout and gameplay experience.

## General Seafarers Rules

### Water Hexes
- Water hexes produce no resources
- No number tokens are placed on water hexes
- Water hexes represent the ocean and cannot be settled
- Fishing villages can be placed on water/land borders (variant rule)

### Gold Fields (when present)
- Gold is a special resource that can be traded for any other single resource
- Counts toward resource variety for trade purposes
- Placed on numbered hexes like any other resource
- Cannot be used to build directly—must be traded first

### Sea Routes & Ships
- Players can build ships along water/land borders (requires Seafarers expansion rules)
- Ships connect islands and allow expansion to distant lands
- Each ship costs 1 lumber + 1 wool (same as roads in some variants)

### Face-Down Hexes (Fog Island & New World)
- Represent unknown or unexplored territory
- Are revealed when a player builds a settlement adjacent to the face-down hex
- Once revealed, the hex functions normally with its resource and number token
- Creates dynamic board discovery during gameplay

## The 9 Scenarios

---

## 1. Heading for New Shores

**Board Dimensions:** 3-4-5-4-5-4-3 (Tall Rectangle)
**Total Hexes:** 19 Land + 19 Sea = 38 hexes

### Hex Distribution
- **4** Forest (Woods)
- **4** Pasture (Sheep)
- **4** Field (Wheat)
- **3** Mountain (Ore)
- **3** Hill (Brick)
- **1** Desert
- **2** Gold Fields
- **19** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
      [L] [L] [L]
     [L] [L] [L] [L]
    [L] [L] [L] [L] [L]
     [L] [L] [S] [L] [L]
      [L] [S] [S] [S] [L]
       [L] [S] [S] [S]
        [S] [S] [S]
```

**Where:** L = Land/Resource, S = Sea

### Setup Notes
- **Mainland (Left Side):** 12-14 resource hexes form a solid landmass on the left
- **The Channel:** A vertical strip of sea hexes runs down the middle, creating a geographic barrier
- **Small Islands (Right Side):** 2-3 tiny islands with 1-2 hexes each on the right side
- **Gold Placement:** Place both gold fields on the small islands as treasure to be discovered
- **Starting Cities:** Players typically begin on the mainland island, using ships to reach the small islands

### Gameplay Focus
This scenario emphasizes exploration and maritime trade. Players must build ships to reach distant islands where valuable resources like gold await. The sea channel creates natural trading boundaries.

**Variant Goal:** First player to have settlements on all three islands wins bonus points.

---

## 2. The Four Islands

**Board Dimensions:** 4-5-5-5-4 (Wide Rectangle)
**Total Hexes:** 20 Land + 19 Sea = 39 hexes

### Hex Distribution
- **4** Forest (Woods)
- **5** Pasture (Sheep)
- **4** Field (Wheat)
- **4** Mountain (Ore)
- **4** Hill (Brick)
- **2** Desert
- **0** Gold Fields
- **19** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
    [I1] [C] [I2]
   [I1] [I1] [C] [I2]
  [I1] [I1] [C] [I2] [I2]
   [I1] [I1] [C] [I2] [I2]
    [I1] [I1] [C] [I2]
```

**Where:** I1-I4 = Island hexes, C = Channel/Sea

### Setup Notes
- **Four Separate Islands:** Divide your 20 resource hexes into 4 equal groups of 5 hexes each
- **Island Shapes:** Each island should be shaped like a small diamond or tight cluster
- **The Cross-Pattern Sea:** Place a "cross" or vertical strip of sea hexes through the center that ensures no two islands are adjacent
- **Island Distribution:** Each island should have 5 hexes (typically 2 resource types distributed 2-1-1-1-1)
- **Starting Positions:** Place starting settlements on different islands to force naval trade from the beginning
- **Desert Placement:** Place both deserts—one on island 1, one on island 2 (or distribute as desired)

### Gameplay Focus
This scenario is perfect for games emphasizing negotiation and trading. With no contact between islands, players must trade heavily via ships. Every player is isolated, creating natural trade opportunities and blocking strategies.

**Variant Goal:** First player to connect to all 4 islands through shipping routes wins.

---

## 3. The Fog Island

**Board Dimensions:** 3-4-5-6-5-4-3 (Large Hexagon)
**Total Hexes:** 37 visible + 14 hidden = 51 hexes total

### Visible Hex Distribution
- **3** Forest (Woods)
- **3** Pasture (Sheep)
- **3** Field (Wheat)
- **3** Mountain (Ore)
- **2** Hill (Brick)
- **19** Sea (Water)
- **4** Face-Down Hexes (revealed later, see Hidden below)

### Hidden (Face-Down) Hex Distribution
- **2** Forest (Woods)
- **2** Pasture (Sheep)
- **2** Field (Wheat)
- **2** Mountain (Ore)
- **3** Hill (Brick)
- **2** Gold Fields
- **1** Desert

### Board Layout

```
      [V] [V] [V]
     [V] [V] [V] [V]
    [V] [V] [?] [V] [V]
   [V] [V] [?] [?] [V] [V]
    [V] [V] [?] [V] [V]
     [V] [V] [V] [V]
      [V] [V] [V]
```

**Where:** V = Visible hexes, ? = Face-down hexes

### Setup Notes
- **Starting Areas:** Place 3-4 resource hexes (visible) at the very top row and very bottom row
- **The Fog (Middle 3 Rows):** Fill the entire middle 3 rows with a mix of face-down hexes
- **Hidden Mix:** The face-down hexes contain additional resources + gold + desert, shuffled randomly
- **Placement Strategy:** Mix visible and hidden hexes within the fog for balanced discovery
- **Random Face-Down Arrangement:** Shuffle all 14 face-down hexes before placing to ensure unpredictable exploration

### Fog Mechanics
- Face-down hexes are revealed one by one as players build settlements adjacent to them
- Once revealed, a face-down hex becomes a normal hex with its resource and number token
- Players cannot see what's under fog until revealed, creating element of surprise
- Could reveal high-value resources like gold or bad hex like desert

### Gameplay Focus
Creates a dramatic exploration experience. Early game is limited to visible hexes, but mid-game opens up as the fog clears. Strategic settlement placement to reveal valuable hexes strategically.

**Variant Goal:** Whoever discovers the most gold fields gets bonus points. First to reveal all fog wins exploration achievement.

## 4. Through the Desert

**Board Dimensions:** 4-5-6-7-6-5-4 (Large Diamond)
**Total Hexes:** 38 Land + 19 Sea = 57 hexes (largest scenario)

### Hex Distribution
- **5** Forest (Woods)
- **5** Pasture (Sheep)
- **5** Field (Wheat)
- **5** Mountain (Ore)
- **5** Hill (Brick)
- **3** Gold Fields
- **5** Desert
- **19** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
       [L] [L] [L] [L]
      [L] [L] [L] [L] [L]
     [L] [L] [L] [L] [L] [L]
    [L] [L] [D] [D] [L] [L] [L]
     [L] [L] [D] [L] [L] [L] [S]
      [L] [L] [L] [L] [L] [S] [G]
       [L] [L] [L] [L] [S] [S] [S]
        [L] [L] [L] [S]
         [L] [L] [S]
          [L] [S]
```

**Where:** L = Land, D = Desert, G = Gold Island, S = Sea

### Setup Notes
- **The Main Continent:** One massive block of land occupying the center-left portion
- **The Wall:** Place all 5 deserts in a vertical line running down the middle of the continent, creating a literal wall dividing the landmass
- **The Sea (Right Side):** The far right and bottom-right of the board are entirely water hexes
- **Gold Islands:** Place the 3 gold fields on tiny islands at the very edges of the sea (isolated 1-hex islands)
- **Desert Purpose:** The desert wall divides the continent into left and right regions, forcing players to choose routes or use ships

### Gameplay Focus
This large scenario is about routing and strategic expansion. The desert wall creates a barrier that can be used tactically. Gold islands at the edges require significant shipping investment to reach. Longest road is typically very valuable here.

**Variant Goal:** First player to successfully reach and claim a gold island gets special achievement. Bridge the desert wall for bonus points.

## 5. The Forgotten Tribe

**Board Dimensions:** 3-4-5-6-5-4-3 (Large Hexagon)
**Total Hexes:** 26 Land + 22 Sea = 48 hexes

### Hex Distribution
- **4** Forest (Woods)
- **4** Pasture (Sheep)
- **4** Field (Wheat)
- **4** Mountain (Ore)
- **4** Hill (Brick)
- **1** Desert
- **2** Gold Fields
- **22** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
    [L][L][L]
   [L][C][C][L]
  [L][C][C][C][L]
 [L][C][L][L][C][L]
  [L][C][C][C][L]
   [L][L][C][L]
    [L][L][L]
```

**Where:** L = Mainland hexes, C = Sea (channel around island), isolated L = Tribal outposts

### Setup Notes
- **The Mainland:** Create a large "C" shaped landmass occupying the center-left of the board (12-15 hexes)
- **Tribal Outposts:** Place single resource hexes in the corners of the board, completely surrounded by sea
- **Isolation:** Each tribal outpost is unreachable except by ship—completely isolated from the main island
- **Strategic Value:** Place one gold field on the main island and one on a tribal outpost
- **Desert Placement:** Place the single desert on the main island away from corner settlements

### Gameplay Focus
Represents discovering forgotten civilizations at board edges. Early game focuses on mainland development. Late game involves bold expeditions to tribal outposts for resources or blocking opponents. High-value trading emerges around rare resources.

**Variant Goal:** Control all four tribal outposts to activate an ancient artifact bonus. First player to settle all corners gains victory point.

## 6. Cloth for Catan

**Board Dimensions:** 4-5-5-5-4 (Wide Rectangle)
**Total Hexes:** 28 Land + 24 Sea = 52 hexes

### Hex Distribution
- **4** Forest (Woods)
- **4** Pasture (Sheep)
- **4** Field (Wheat)
- **4** Mountain (Ore)
- **4** Hill (Brick)
- **2** Desert
- **2** Gold Fields
- **24** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
   [H1] [H1] [S] [V] [S]
  [H1] [H1] [H1] [V] [S] [H2]
 [H1] [H1] [S] [V] [S] [H2] [H2]
  [H1] [H1] [S] [V] [S] [H2]
   [H1] [H1] [S] [V] [S]
```

**Where:** H1/H2 = Home Islands, V = Villages, S = Sea

### Setup Notes
- **Home Islands:** Two medium islands (6-8 hexes each) positioned on far left and far right edges
- **Sea Lane:** A wide ocean strip runs down the middle (4-5 sea hexes wide)
- **Villages:** Place 4-5 isolated 1-hex islands in the middle of the sea lane
- **Village Resources:** Villages contain mixed resources (spread them evenly)
- **Desert Distribution:** Place 1 desert on each home island
- **Gold Placement:** Place 2 gold fields on the villages (1 each, or both on one village)

### Gameplay Focus
Trade-focused scenario with extreme separation. Home islands can become self-sufficient early, but villages provide crucial resources unavailable at home. Requires managing naval commerce. Heavy on negotiation since trade is essential for resource balance.

**Variant Goal:** Control the most villages. First player to have settlements on both home island AND in the village cluster gains trade monopoly bonus.

## 7. The Pirate Islands

**Board Dimensions:** 4-5-6-6-5-4 (Wide Rectangle)
**Total Hexes:** 28 Land + 24 Sea = 52 hexes

### Hex Distribution
- **4** Forest (Woods)
- **4** Pasture (Sheep)
- **4** Field (Wheat)
- **4** Mountain (Ore)
- **4** Hill (Brick)
- **2** Desert
- **2** Gold Fields
- **24** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
    [S][S][L][L][S][S]
   [S][S][L][L][L][S][S]
  [S][S][P1][P1][S][S][S]
   [S][S][L][L][L][S][S]
    [S][S][L][L][S][S]
```

**Where:** L = Land strips on edges, P1/P2 = Pirate lairs, S = Sea

### Setup Notes
- **Side Strips:** A narrow strip of land (3 hexes wide, 4-5 hexes long) on the far left and far right edges
- **Pirate Fortresses (Lairs):** In the dead center, create two 2-hex islands
- **Fortress Composition:** Each fortress contains mixed resources (e.g., 1 ore + 1 wheat per fortress)
- **All Else is Sea:** All space between the side strips and center fortresses is open ocean
- **Isolation:** Pirates are completely cut off from mainland—must be reached by sea
- **No Deserts:** Pirate fortresses replace the need for deserts, making them valuable targets
- **Gold Placement:** Place 2 gold fields in the pirate fortresses

### Gameplay Focus
Highly maritime-focused with competition over central pirate lairs. Early game develops side territories independently. Mid-late game is dominated by naval battles for pirate fortress control. Creates natural "center of the board" conflict.

**Variant Goal:** Control both pirate fortresses to become "Pirate King" (2-point bonus). Hold a fortress uncontested for 3 turns to activate its vault (draw bonus card).

## 8. The Wonders of Catan

**Board Dimensions:** 4-5-6-7-6-5-4 (Large Diamond)
**Total Hexes:** 38 Land + 19 Sea = 57 hexes

### Hex Distribution
- **5** Forest (Woods)
- **5** Pasture (Sheep)
- **5** Field (Wheat)
- **5** Mountain (Ore)
- **5** Hill (Brick)
- **3** Gold Fields
- **5** Desert
- **19** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
       [L][L][L][L]
      [L][L][L][L][L]
     [L][L][L][L][L][L]
    [L][L][L][L][L][L][L]
     [L][L][L][L][L][G][S]
      [L][L][L][L][G][S][S]
       [L][L][L][G][S][S][S]
        [S][S][S][S][S][S]
         [S][S][S][S]
```

**Where:** L = Mainland, G = Gold, S = Sea

### Setup Notes
- **The Main Land:** One giant, solid island taking up the left 2/3 of the board
- **The Gold Chain:** A vertical "string" of gold and sea hexes forms the right edge
- **Gold Islands:** 3 gold fields arranged diagonally down the right edge, each isolated by sea
- **Desert Distribution:** Place all 5 deserts scattered throughout the main landmass (not on edges)
- **Resource Balance:** Ensure main island has balanced access to all resources

### Gameplay Focus
Creates dramatic asymmetry. Main island supports stable base, but endgame pivots toward gold rush on right side. Late-game sees rapid expansion toward gold islands. Controls central "wonder" concept where gold represents rare treasures worth significant effort.

**Variant Goal:** Collect all 3 gold fields to construct a "Wonder" (instant victory). First player to reach 15 points wins; 12 points if they control all gold.

---

## 9. New World (Random Exploration)

**Board Dimensions:** 3-4-5-6-5-4-3 (Large Hexagon)
**Total Hexes:** 42 hexes (all face-down initially except starting area)

### Hex Distribution (Mixed, Face-Down)
- **6** Forest (Woods)
- **6** Pasture (Sheep)
- **6** Field (Wheat)
- **6** Mountain (Ore)
- **6** Hill (Brick)
- **3** Desert
- **2** Gold Fields
- **4** Safe Harbor hexes (visible from start)
- **20+** Sea (Water)

### Board Layout

```
      [H][H][?][?][?]
     [H][H][?][?][?][?]
    [H][H][H][?][?][?][?]
     [H][H][?][?][?][?]
      [H][H][?][?][?]
       [?][?][?][?]
        [?][?][?]
```

**Where:** H = Safe Harbor (visible starting area), ? = Face-down exploration hexes, S = Sea

### Setup Notes
- **Safe Harbor:** Place a small 4-hex "safe" harbor area in one corner—these hexes are visible from the start
- **All Other Hexes Are Face-Down:** Every hex except the safe harbor starts face-down
- **Completely Random:** Shuffle all 38+ hexes (land + sea + gold) into face-down state
- **Discovery Mechanism:** As players build settlements adjacent to face-down hexes, those hexes are revealed
- **Mixed Hidden Hexes:** The face-down stack includes resources, deserts, gold, and sea hexes
- **No Initial Planning:** Players cannot plan routes—must discover as they expand

### Gameplay Focus
Most dynamic and unpredictable scenario. Creates true "exploration" feel. Early game focuses on developing safe harbor. Mid-game becomes rush to discover favorable hexes before opponents. Late-game becomes race to reach key resources discovered along the way.

**Discovery Mechanics:**
- When a player builds a settlement or road adjacent to a face-down hex, immediately reveal it
- Reveal carries no number token assignment—use random assignment or pre-shuffled tokens
- Multiple settlements can trigger multiple reveals in one turn
- Creates element of luck alongside strategy

**Variant Goal:** First to reach 15 points. Bonus: Whoever discovers the most gold fields gets 1 free point. First player to discover all deserts on the board "masters the wild" and gains 2-point bonus.
